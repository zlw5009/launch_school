# Which of the following are objects in Ruby? 
# If they are objects, how can you find out what class 
# they belong to?

true # => this is a boolean object
"hello" # => this is a string object
[1, 2, 3, "happy days"] # => this is an array object
142 # => this is a fixnum object

# => we can find which class they belong to by calling (some_object).class

# In the previous two exercises, you developed methods that convert simple
# numeric strings to signed Integers. In this exercise and the next, you're
# going to reverse those methods.

# Write a method that takes a positive integer or zero,
# and converts it to a string representation.

# You may not use any of the standard conversion methods available in Ruby,
# such as Integer#to_s, String(), Kernel#format, etc. Your method should do this
# the old-fashioned way and construct the string by analyzing and manipulating the number.

# Examples

# integer_to_string(4321) == '4321'
# integer_to_string(0) == '0'
# integer_to_string(5000) == '5000'

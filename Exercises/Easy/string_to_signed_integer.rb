# In the previous exercise, you developed a method that converts simple
# numeric strings to Integers. In this exercise, you're going to extend
# that method to work with signed numbers.

# Write a method that takes a String of digits, and returns the appropriate
# number as an integer. The String may have a leading + or - sign; if the
# first character is a +, your method should return a positive number;
# if it is a -, your method should return a negative number.
# If no sign is given, you should return a positive number.

# You may assume the string will always contain a valid number.

# You may not use any of the standard conversion methods available in Ruby,
# such as String#to_i, Integer(), etc. You may, however, use the string_to_integer
# method from the previous lesson.

# Examples

# string_to_signed_integer('4321') == 4321
# string_to_signed_integer('-570') == -570
# string_to_signed_integer('+100') == 100

DIGITS = {
  '0' => 0, '1' => 1, '2' => 2, '3' => 3, '4' => 4,
  '5' => 5, '6' => 6, '7' => 7, '8' => 8, '9' => 9
}

def string_to_integer(string)
  value = 0

  string.chars.map { |char| DIGITS[char] }.each do |digit|
    value = 10 * value + digit
  end
  
  value
end

def string_to_signed_integer(string)
  case string[0]
  when '-' then -string_to_integer(string[1..-1])
  when '+' then string_to_integer(string[1..-1])
  else          string_to_integer(string)
  end
end

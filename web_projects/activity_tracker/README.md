# Study Time Tracker

### Purpose:
This application allows users to enter subjects along with topics related to that subject. The user will then be able to log their time spent on each topic to track their overall time spent on a subject.

### API's:
This application is built using Sinatra 1.4.7 along with Ruby -v 2.2.1 and the PostgreSQL gem (PG). 

### Notes:
This application is built as a personal project to reiterate knowledge and education obtained through the www.launchschool.com curriculum. As I progress through the program, I wanted to not only ensure that I was spending adequate time maintaining my knowledge on previous materials but also start building a portfolio of database driven application. What better way to start out than to build an application that tracks the amount of time spent on each subject and their corresponding topics.
